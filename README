What's IO ?
___________

IO is an open source note-taking software using encryption methods.
Due to its simplicity and lightness, it becomes fast to create and protect
your notes by password and encrypt them using GPG.

The IO interface is built using GTK + and is available only on GNU / Linux
platforms. Sorry if you are using Win**** but maybe one day...


How to install IO ?
___________________

To build IO, you must compile the source files, but before proceeding, make
sure you have satisfied the required dependencies to run the program.
Use your package manager and install the following packages if they are not
already present on your system:

  _ gnupg
  _ pkg-config
  _ GTK+-2
  _ gobject-introspection
  _ pango
  _ GDK

Go to the source files folder using your terminal ('src') and run the
following commands:

  make &&
  sudo make install

You should not have any problems but if you encounter any difficulties, do not
hesitate to contact the development team at:
	philentropy@protonmail.ch
Or use Github's dedicated space for.


I've got errors, bugs or unexpected behaviors. What shall I do ?
________________________________________________________________


Please, go to 'doc' and find a dummy issue report file (io_issue-dummy).
Copy it, fill it and then send it to the IO's dev team at:
  philentropy@protonmail.ch

These reports are important and help us to bring you the best we can do !
Maybe you can fix it ? Well, write a patch and submit it (rewarded in cookies).


I  want to do more than use IO. What can I do ?
_______________________________________________
At first, thank you for using IO and if you have time or talent (or both), we
invite you to add your stone to the building. You can contribute by writing
documentation, providing patches, improving code, feedback bugs and errors and
so much more. At each level someone can help and that's our strength, us, free
software enthusiasts. Whether we are a developer, a worker, a boss
or an artist, whatever, we believe in the same values.
Together, let's write the source code of freedom.
